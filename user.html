			<h2>Anthony Schreier</h2>
			<p>The Legend of Zelda is one of my all time favorite games. I thought it would be awesome and fun to theme this assignment after it. I've played just about every Zelda game out,
			ocarina of time is my fovorite of them all. Althought the first Legend of Zelda for the NES is my second. I hope you enjoyed the site!</p>
